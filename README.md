# Python Turtle Spirographs and Google Logo

This repository contains Python code for creating spirographs and printing the Google logo using the Turtle graphics library, as well as some basic instructions and documentation links on how to use this library :)

## Spirographs

The spirograph module allows you to create intricate geometric patterns known as spirographs. Spirographs are created by rolling a small circle inside or outside a larger fixed circle, while a pen traces the resulting curves.

To run the spirograph program, execute the `spirograph.py` script. You can customize the spirograph patterns by modifying the parameters such as radii, pen colors, and speeds within the code.

## Google Logo

The `google-logo.py` script demonstrates how to draw the Google logo using Python Turtle. It recreates the iconic multi-colored logo of the search engine giant by using the appropriate colors and positioning.

To print the Google logo, run the `google-logo.py` script. Make sure the `turtle` module is installed on your Python environment.

## Tutorial and Documentation

Although these instructions are already contained within the `tutorial.py` file, if you are new to Python Turtle or need a refresher, here are some resources to get started:

- [Python Turtle Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) - Official Python documentation for the Turtle graphics library.
- [Turtle Graphics Tutorial](https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/) - A beginner-friendly tutorial on Turtle graphics from Real Python.
- [Spirograph Tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) - Wikipedia article explaining the principles and history of spirographs.

Feel free to explore this code and modify it.
